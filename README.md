# CVZONE_drone_ChimeraMultimedia
CVZONE competition


Here I implemented a car counter according to this competition: https://www.computervision.zone/dsc/.
I used the Yolo5+deepsort repo (https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch), trained on the given video as a dataset, and modified the code a bit for the purpose of the contest (track.py from line 210-233).

The modifications are the following:
- I store the detected ID-s in an array, and I append those which was not in the array to count the cars.
- Sometimes there are similar cars, so the algorithm detects them the same as previous cars, so it gives the same ID to a different car. If this happens I multiply the ID with 100 to distinguish it from the previous car and I count it as a new one.
- If cars slowly disappear from the screen at the top, sometimes the algorithm detects them as new cars, therefore after 10 frames, I only count those cars which are detected in the bottom half of the screen to ensure that I do not recount cars.

Usage:

Install every prerequisite according to this repo: https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch

Just go to the folder where the track.py file is located and then execute the following command:

```
python3 track.py --source ./cvzone_cars_vid.mp4 --yolo_weights ./yolov5/best.pt --show-vid --save-vid
```python

## Introduction

This repository contains a two-stage-tracker. The detections generated by [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, are passed to a [Deep Sort algorithm](https://github.com/ZQPei/deep_sort_pytorch) which tracks the objects. It can track any object that your Yolov5 model was trained to detect.

## Before you run the tracker

1. Clone the repository recursively:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch.git`

If you already cloned and forgot to use `--recurse-submodules` you can run `git submodule update --init`

2. Make sure that you fulfill all the requirements: Python 3.8 or later with all [requirements.txt](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch/blob/master/requirements.txt) dependencies installed, including torch>=1.7. To install, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Tracking sources

Tracking can be run on most video formats

```bash
python3 track.py --source ... --show-vid  # show live inference results as well
```

- Video:  `--source file.mp4`
- Webcam:  `--source 0`
- RTSP stream:  `--source rtsp://170.93.143.139/rtplive/470011e600ef003a004ee33696235daa`
- HTTP stream:  `--source http://wmccpinetop.axiscam.net/mjpg/video.mjpg`


## Select a Yolov5 family model

There is a clear trade-off between model inference speed and accuracy. In order to make it possible to fulfill your inference speed/accuracy needs
you can select a Yolov5 family model for automatic download

```bash
python3 track.py --source 0 --yolo_weights yolov5s.pt --img 640  # smallest yolov5 family model
```

```bash
python3 track.py --source 0 --yolo_weights yolov5x6.pt --img 1280  # largest yolov5 family model
```


## Filter tracked classes

By default the tracker tracks all MS COCO classes.

If you only want to track persons I recommend you to get [these weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gglIwqxaH2iTvy6lZlXuAcMpd_U0GCUb/view?usp=sharing) for increased performance

```bash
python3 track.py --source 0 --yolo_weights yolov5/weights/crowdhuman_yolov5m.pt --classes 0  # tracks persons, only
```

If you want to track a subset of the MS COCO classes, add their corresponding index after the classes flag

```bash
python3 track.py --source 0 --yolo_weights yolov5s.pt --classes 16 17  # tracks cats and dogs, only
```

[Here](https://tech.amikelive.com/node-718/what-object-categories-labels-are-in-coco-dataset/) is a list of all the possible objects that a Yolov5 model trained on MS COCO can detect. Notice that the indexing for the classes in this repo starts at zero.


## MOT compliant results

Can be saved to `inference/output` by 

```bash
python3 track.py --source ... --save-txt
```
